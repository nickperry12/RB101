Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. 
And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1) what is != and where should you use it?
2) put ! before something, like !user_name
3) put ! after something, like words.uniq!
4) put ? before something
5) put ? after something
6) put !! before something, like !!user_name

[!] is the Logical Not operator. It is used to invert an expressions boolean value.
[?] is a ternary operator and is used to write compact if/else statements.
If these are seen at the end of a method, they are apart of the method name itself.

1) [!=] is the 'not equal' to operator. It is used to say that the expression on the
left side of the operator is not equal to the expression on the right

2) If you put [!] before something, like a username, it will reverse the boolean value
of that object. For example, if you were to write !true, the output would be false. 

3) While it is not always the case, putting [!] after a method mutates the caller. 
So if you were to write words.uniq!, the object words would be mutated and the changes
would be permanent. 

4) Putting a [?] before an object will return an error

5) Putting a [?] after something depends on what that something is. Putting it after
an object (like a variable) will return an error. However, putting it after a method
(this is dependent on the method) indicates that a method returns a boolean value, or
an object to indicate a truthy value.

6) Putting [!!] before an object will check the boolean value of that object.
For example -- !!(2 + 5 == 8) will return false.

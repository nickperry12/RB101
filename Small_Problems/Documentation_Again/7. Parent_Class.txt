**REVIEW FOR FURTHER UNDERSTANDING

Use irb to run the following code:

s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods.inspect

How would you modify this code to print just the public methods that are defined or
overridden by the String class? That is, the list should exclude all members that are
only defined in Object, BasicObject, and Kernel.

Solution:
The documentation states: Returns the list of public methods accessible to obj.
If the all parameter is set to false, only those methods in the receiver will be listed.

public_methods(all=true) â†’ array

In this case, our object is string, so the method will will return a list of all public methods that
are available to String as well as any Parent classes. 
By setting the all parameter to false, it will only return the methods available to the String object
and ignore the ones in all Parent classes. Therefore, the code should look like this

s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods(false).inspect

The Array#bsearch method is used to search ordered Arrays more quickly than #find and #select
can. Assume you have the following code:

a = [1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19]

How would you search this Array to find the first element whose value exceeds 8?

value = a.bsearch { |num| num > 8}

The signature for bsearch (bsearch {|element| ... } â†’ object) shows that the method
takes a block as an argument. The block has two modes - find-minimum and find-any.
Find-minimum mode will search through the array and will return the first number that
returns a truthy value. We can then assign that object to a local variable value.

In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing a program that
loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with YAML::load_file:

require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')

Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.

Solution:

Because we have to require 'yaml', we know that the documentation won't be apart of the core API,
and instead we should look to the Standard Library to find the documentaion. The YAML page 
does not have much information in it, but points you in the direction of the Psych module:

For more advanced details on the implementation see Psych, and also check out yaml.org
for spec details and other helpful information.

When we go to the Psych module, we are able to find ::load_file which states:

Loads the document contained in filename. Returns the yaml contained in filename as a
Ruby object, or if the file is empty, it returns the specified fallback return value,
which defaults to false. See load for options.

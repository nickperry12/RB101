file#path returns the pathname used to create a file as a string. Does not normalize the name.
This method is used in the creation of a new file. Used specifically for file names.

file::path returns the string representaton of the path.
This method is used with file paths that already exist. Used specifically for file paths.

Launch School Solution:

File::path is a class method, file#path is a instance method.
Class methods are called on a class:
puts File.path('bin')

Instance methods are called on an object:
f = File.new('my-file.txt')
puts f.path

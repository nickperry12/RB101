Assume you have the following code:

require 'date'

puts Date.civil
puts Date.civil(2016)
puts Date.civil(2016, 5)
puts Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)

Solution:

Because we need to import the date class, we know it won't be found in the core library,
but instead can be found in the standard library

1. Date.civil => -4712-01-01
This is the default return output. -4712 marks the first year of the Julian period, 1m, 1d are
the default month and date, respectively. These are the default values which are returned
when no argument is given.

2. Date.civil(2016) => 2016-01-01
No arguments were provided for the month and day, but 2016 was provided for the year.

3. Date.civil(2016, 5) => 2016-05-01
Arguments were provided the year and month, but no for the day, so it defaults to 01.

4. Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)
Arguments were provided for year, month and day.

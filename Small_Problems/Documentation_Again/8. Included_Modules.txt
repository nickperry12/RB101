**REVIEW FURTHER. NEED TO FURTHER EXPLORE WHERE TO FIND THESE METHODS IF NOT INCLUDED
**IN THE CLASS YOU ORIGINALLY CHECKED.

Use irb to run the following code:

a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min

Find the documentation for the #min method and change the above code to print the two smallest values
in the array.

Solution:

The documentation states:
Returns the element with the minimum element according to a given criterion. The ordering
of equal elements is indeterminate and may be unstable.

min(n) â†’ array

We could edit the code to be:

puts a.min(2) 

Which will output the two smallest values in the array => 3, 5

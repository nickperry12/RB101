Steps for the game:

1) Display an empty 3x3 board
2) Ask the user to mark a square
3) Computer marks a square
4) Display the updated board
5) If there is a winner, display the winner
6) If the board is full and no winner, display a tie
7) If no winner and board is not full, go to step 2
8) Ask user if they'd like to play again
9) If yes, go to step 1
10) If no, game ends

AI for detecting board threat:

We have our board squares stored in a hash as key-value pairs, where the key is
the integer representing a square, and the value is either single space in a
string (' ') or a player marker ('X' or 'O')

We want our AI to detect whether a winning line (either horizontal, diagonal or
vertical) consists of two player markers.

We currently have an array filled with sub-arrays, with each sub-array
representing a winning line. How can we use these data structures to detect a
threat?

We can't use the select methods on the WINNING_LINES array because these arrays
don't have the player markers in them, our hash does. But we could use the
`values_at` method. We can iterate through WINNING_LINES with the `each`
and pass the current line into the `values_at` method like so:

def computer_detect_threat(brd)
  threat_line = WINNING_LINES.select do |line|
    brd.values_at(*line).count(PLAYER_MARKER) == 2 &&
    brd.values_at(*line).count(' ') == 1
  end
end

This returns us the line that consists of two `PLAYER_MARKLER`s and one empty
space. Now we need to figure out how we can use this to select the square from
this nested array. 

We could do:

square = threat_line.index(' ')

This will assign square the index number where (' ') is stored.

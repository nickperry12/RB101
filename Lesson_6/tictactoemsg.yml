rules: "These are the rules: The board consists of 9 squares in a 3x3 grid.\n
Each player will have their own marker:\n
The player marker is 'X' and the computer marker is 'O'.\n
Each player will then take turns placing their marker in an empty square.\n
\n
The player to make the first move will be randomized at the start of each game. \n
In order to win the game, a player must place their marker in 3 consecutive\n
squares, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.\n
\n
If the board is filled with neither player filling 3 consecutive\n
squares, it's a tie!\n
\n
\n
Get ready to play and good luck!"
